# UK Biobank Research Analyses Platform (RAP)

UK Biobank Research Analyses Platform (RAP) enables researchers working with UK Biobank's large-scale biomedical database and research resource, to access it in the cloud from anywhere in the world. It has been designed to accommodate the vast and increasing scale of the UK Biobank resource.

## Notes prior to analysis

We complete null model fitting in local service and conduct set-based analysis in UK Biobank RAP. Please ensure the subjects in null model fitting are also in genotype files.
