# SPAGxE<sub>CCT</sub> method 

**SPAGxE<sub>CCT</sub> is a G×E analysis framework designed for a wide range of complex traits with intricate structures, including time-to-event, ordinal categorical, binary, quantitative, longitudinal, and other complex traits.** The framework involves two main steps:

- Step 1: SPAGxE<sub>CCT</sub> fits a covariates-only model to calculate model residuals. These covariates include, but are not limited to, confounding factors such as age, sex, SNP-derived principal components (PCs), and environmental factors. The specifics of the model and residuals vary depending on the trait type. Since the covariates-only model is genotype-independent, it only needs to be fitted once across a genome-wide analysis.

- Step 2: SPAGxE<sub>CCT</sub> identifies genetic variants with marginal G×E effects on the trait of interest. First, marginal genetic effects are tested using score statistics. If the marginal genetic effect is not significant, S<sub>G×E</sub> is used as the test statistic to characterize the marginal G×E effect. If significant, S<sub>G×E</sub> is updated to genotype-adjusted test statistics. To balance computational efficiency and accuracy, SPAGxE<sub>CCT</sub> employs a hybrid strategy combining normal distribution approximation and saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calculate p-values, as used in previous studies such as [SAIGE](https://saigegit.github.io/SAIGE-doc/) and [SPAGE](https://github.com/WenjianBI/SPAGE). For variants with significant marginal genetic effects, SPAGxE<sub>CCT</sub> additionally calculates p value through Wald test and uses Cauchy combination (CCT) to combine p values from Wald test and the proposed genotype-adjusted test statistics.
