**Development source.** SPAGxE 1.2.0 is published on [develop](https://github.com/YuzhuoMa97/SPAGxECCT/tree/develop). [Hosted checks for d90fb4c](https://github.com/YuzhuoMa97/SPAGxECCT/actions/runs/41416750904) passed Windows and Ubuntu; macOS numerical unit checks failed and the platform remains unvalidated. The C++ release tag and runtime assets are not yet published. See the [validation record](/RetroSPAgwas.github.io/docs/spagxe_cpp/validation.html) and [development status](/RetroSPAgwas.github.io/docs/spagxe_cpp/development_status.html) for the tested revision and download instructions. Later source commits require their own checks.

# SPAGxE+ C++ example {#spagxe-c-example}

Use the complete source checkout or binary bundle with its example files. First follow
[installation](/RetroSPAgwas.github.io/docs/spagxe_cpp/installation.html) and read [the development status](/RetroSPAgwas.github.io/docs/spagxe_cpp/development_status.html).
The Bash commands below run inside `cpp/`, after a successful source build:

```sh
SPAGXE=./build/bin/SPAGxE
OUT=results/website_four_methods
mkdir -p "$OUT"
```

For an extracted Windows binary bundle, the executable inside `cpp/` is `./SPAGxE.exe`.
Use the supplied CMD/PowerShell examples from the [tutorial scripts](/RetroSPAgwas.github.io/docs/spagxe_cpp/tutorial_scripts.html)
when running in Windows; Bash backslash continuations are not PowerShell syntax.

## Analysis command {#analysis-command}

<!-- example: UG03_plus_table -->
```sh
"$SPAGXE" --method SPAGxE+ --bfile examples/synthetic/synthetic \
  --pheno examples/synthetic/synthetic.pheno --pheno-name Quantitative \
  --covar-name X1,E,PC1,PC2 --envir-name E \
  --grm-file examples/synthetic/synthetic.grm.tsv \
  --mac 0 --maf 0 --geno 1 --out "$OUT/plus_table"
```

The table header is `ID1 ID2 VALUE`. VALUE is relationship, or twice kinship;
self relationship is 1+F. Do not pass kinship values while describing them as
relationship. The same method is selected by supplying a GRM with SPAGxE.
Related-sample output uses the SPA/normal score leg without an IID Wald leg;
its file suffix is `.SPAGxE`, with the plus method identified by the command.

## Read and retain the result {#read-and-retain-the-result}

Inspect the analysis settings receipt, sample/variant counts, branch and failure status.
The LOG10P columns report -log10(P); NA indicates a missing/failed calculation, not P=1.
The small bundled examples use permissive QC to expose edge cases. Choose and record
scientific cohort thresholds before interpreting a scan.

Continue with the [complete tutorial](/RetroSPAgwas.github.io/docs/spagxe_cpp/full_tutorial.html#run-the-four-methods) for phenotype models,
residual reuse, other genotype formats, selection/QC, local packing, CCT, AF export,
output compression and resource settings. The [CLI reference](/RetroSPAgwas.github.io/docs/spagxe_cpp/cli.html) defines each option.
