# Overview of restropective saddlepoint approximation (SPA) methods in GWAS

The restropective saddlepoint approximation (SPA) methods are mainly designed to conduct **genome-wide association studies (GWAS)** in terms of both single-variant and set-based analysis. 

## Genome-wide association studies

All retrospective-SPA-based GWAS approaches share the same analysis framework including the following two steps

- Step 1: Fit a null model using trait, covariates, and GRM (if applied).
- Step 2: Conduct single-variant or set-based tests to identify marker or marker-set (e.g. gene) significantly associated with the trait of interest.


##  Genome-wide gene-environment interaction (GxE) studies

All retrospective-SPA-based GxE approaches share the same analysis framework including the following two steps

- Step 1: Fit a genotype-independent (covariates-only) model using trait, covariates, and GRM (if applied).
- Step 2: Conduct single-variant or set-based tests to identify marker or marker-set (e.g. gene) significantly associated with the trait of interest.
